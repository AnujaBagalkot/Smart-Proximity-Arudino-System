Smart Proximity Arduino System

Overview:-

This project demonstrates a Smart Proximity Detection System using Arduino Uno and an ultrasonic sensor.
The system detects the presence of an object or person within a defined distance and triggers an output (LED) accordingly.

It is designed as a foundational embedded systems project to understand sensor interfacing, real-time decision making, and microcontroller programming.

Objectives:-

To measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor

To detect proximity based on a threshold distance

To control an output device (LED) using Arduino logic

To understand hardware–software interaction

Components Used:- 
Component	            Quantity
Arduino Uno                     1
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	1
LED	                        1
Resistor (220Ω / 330Ω)   	1
Breadboard	                1
Jumper Wires (Male–Male)	As required
USB Cable	                1

Pin Connections:-
Arduino Pin	 Connected To
5V	         Sensor VCC
GND	         Sensor GND & LED GND
D9	         Sensor TRIG
D10	         Sensor ECHO
D6	         LED (via resistor)

Working Principle:-

Arduino sends an ultrasonic pulse through the TRIG pin

The pulse reflects from an object and returns to the ECHO pin

Arduino calculates distance using time-of-flight

If the distance is below a defined threshold:

LED turns ON

If the distance exceeds the threshold:

LED turns OFF

Logic Used:-

Distance is calculated using:

distance = duration × speed of sound / 2


Conditional logic (if-else) is used to compare distance with threshold

Serial monitoring is used for debugging and distance visualization
